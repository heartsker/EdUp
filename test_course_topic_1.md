## Here we go

Hello!

This is **iOS-development** course for beginners. Here we will steadily and step-by-step learn basics of programming and get an experience of designing a mobile app from scratch. You will get all knowledges you need to start your career as a **developer**!

## Where to start?

We are learning programming language Swift. All information about it you can find on the official site [here](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)

To start you will need any Appleâ€™s computer and application Xcode - you can download it [here](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) - it is fully free

During the whole course you will be facing some code blobs. That is OK just to read and understand them, but more useful for would be to try to experiment with it. Try to write the same code and play with it!

The best way to do so is to create a new playground project in Xcode, going File â†’ New â†’ Playground â†’ Blank *(or use shortcut **âŒ¥ â‡§ âŒ˜ N**)*

## How will it go?

This course is separated to stories - each one contains topics - detailed explanation of small piece of the whole story

After each story you are to complete practical exercise - do not cheat on them - it is always better to take a step back and recall something than just pass the challenge ðŸ˜‰

## Authorâ€™s recommendations

Hi and welcome to my iOS development course

In this course I will try to explain every single topic as complete as possible. That is why sometimes that could seem a little nerdy (sorry for that ðŸ˜¬), but exactly this tediousness will contrast you from other developers

I want to warn you. iOS developer - is not just about pretty animations and handsome colored lines of simple code. That is also about hardworking, deep understanding in all the full stack development spheres and hardworking

I hope you will enjoy reading this stories and we will fully immerse ourselves together in unbelievably curious and vast developerâ€™s world

> **Now we are ready to start**
**I wish you luck!**
